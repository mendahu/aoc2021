# Advent of Code 2021

This is my repository for working through the Advent of Code 2021 using Ruby as a language. I am not good at Ruby, so please treat all code here and pretty crap.

I am practicing object-oriented code through this project, and as such am self-imposing a sort of extra challenge of building the solutions into associated classes that all link together like some kind of unified application. Maybe this is dumb, but there's only one way to find out for sure.

# Solutions

To get the solutions:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `irb -r ./start.rb` to enter the Ruby shell.
3. Access the automatically created Submarine class instance via the variable `@sub`.
4. Follow the steps below to interact

## Day 1

1. Call method `@sub.report_depth_increases_by_group_size(1)` to produce the answer.
2. Call method `@sub.report_depth_increases_by_group_size(3)` to produce the answer.

You can call this method with any group size as needed.

## Day 2

1. Call method `@sub.report_new_position` to produce the answer.
2. Call method `@sub.report_better_new_position` to produce the answer.

## Day 3

1. Call method `@sub.report_power_consumption` to produce the answer
1. Call method `@sub.report_life_support_rating` to produce the answer

## Day 4

1. Call method `@sub.validate_bingo_results` to produce the answer
